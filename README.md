# W02D01 - TDD with Mocha & Chai

### To Do
- [ ] Practicing unit testing via the Test Driven Development
- [ ] Demonstrate the Mocha test framework
- [ ] Demonstrate the Chai assertion library
- [ ] Export and import JS using Node's default syntax

### TDD
- Test Driven Development
- n-Driven Development (Behaviour, Error, Component)
- Putting thought into your work before you code
- We write our tests (ideally) before we write our code
- Red: our tests are failing
- Green: our tests are passing (we write minimum amount of code to make the test pass)
- Refactor: fearless refactoring
